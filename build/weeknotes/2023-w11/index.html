<p>This week I finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56097208-artifact-space">Artifact Space</a> by <a href="https://mastodon.online/@Cameronauthor">Miles Cameron</a>. Really enjoyed it!</p>

<p>It's space opera with good stuff like mysterious alien ruins and merchant navy life among the stars.</p>

<p>I especially appreciated how the main space ship has wood panelling, acanthus-leaf etchings, paintings of old captains and so on – a far cry from Star Trek minimalism.</p>

<p>We spent a night in our own guest room, just because we can.</p>

<p>There's something magical about a really cosy guest room, and making one has been one of my goals.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I watched the last of "The Last of Us". It was rather good, but I didn't <em>love</em> it.</p>

<p>Speaking of Pedro Pascal leading children through danger, we watched "The Mandalorian" S03E02 and it was one of the most boring, least inspired things I've seen in a long time. Hope it picks back up.</p>

<p>We rewatched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/">The Net (1995)</a>. Not amazing, but pretty entertaining. I expected it to feel more outdated than it did.</p>

<p>I was very glad to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bErJpKrEhzc">a video</a> of someone even more picky about their desk cable situation than I am.</p>

<p>I got an unexpected and strangely coincidental windfall.</p>

<p>When selling my old display, I found the contract for our old flat in the packaging. We moved out 6 years ago.</p>

<p>A few days later – this week – I got an automatic email from the UK Deposit Protection Service about getting the deposit back for that flat – a decent amount of money.</p>

<p>I very carefully provided some non-sensitive details, thinking it might be a high-quality phishing attempt, but the money landed in my account a few days later.</p>

<p>I suppose we forgot about the deposit in the hustle and bustle of buying a house and moving, and finding the contract somehow pinged the agent through the ether.</p>
