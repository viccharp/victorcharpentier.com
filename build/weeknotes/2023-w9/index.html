<p>Trying to be fair to the first person in line, not hearing back for a day or two, repeat.</p>

<p>I sold something for £15 that I really should have just donated, but I saw it through out of perverse fascination.</p>

<p>Also listed something on eBay. Equal parts impressed and exhausted with the listing process. They've clearly put a lot of work into it, and there's a lot <em>of</em> it.</p>

<p>We rewatched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075860/">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)</a>. Very much <em>A Movie</em>. Good attention to detail. A bit nothingy in the end, but I enjoyed the journey.</p>

<p>We also tried to watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096754/">The Abyss (1989)</a> and did not finish. A bit dull, frankly, which probably contributed to it being hard to follow.</p>

<p>Sunday was a rare day of TV sports.</p>

<p>My partner watches one sporting event a year, the cross-country ski race <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasaloppet">Vasaloppet</a> with roots in her corner of Sweden. That was Sunday morning.</p>

<p>I'd ordered the requisite <a href="https://www.vasaloppet.se/en/about-us/history/blueberry-soup/">bilberry soup</a> weeks in advance, since you don't find it in UK supermarkets.</p>

<p>Then we went on a day trip, and I watched the F1 race when we got back.</p>

<p>I rarely watch sports, but I'd been told I might enjoy Formula 1. So like a lot of people, I tried <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8289930/">Drive to Survive</a> a few months ago and did indeed enjoy it. It's an intriguing combination of business, applied science, interpersonal (melo)­drama, strategy and action.</p>

<p>And it's fun to get a view into a world I hadn't paid any attention to previously.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>The day trip was to <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/lake-district/sizergh">Sizergh</a> in the Lake District.</p>

<p>The Lakes are less than 2 hours away, but it feels like you're on holiday when you get there. We should go more often.</p>

<p>We walked around the lovely gardens, petted Charlie the castle cat, had a picnic and bought gifts.</p>

<p>We got a bag of vinegar crisps in the café to upgrade our brought sandwiches to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisp_sandwich">crisp sandwiches</a>. UK food gets a bad rap, but crisp sandwiches are a delight.</p>

<p>A quote I appreciated, about a grandfather and grandson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They were so alike that Bashford says they can even be thought of as "one very long-lived man, 1825-1975."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're probably done painting the dining room table. And I'm almost done painting a chair we got for it. More nooks and crannies than you can shake a brush at.</p>

<p>Upholstery fabric samples have been ordered for chair seats.</p>

<p>A frustrating thing about DIY is that I have perfectionist tastes, but not the skills.</p>

<p>Unlike work, where I've done it long enough that I feel like I <em>can</em> often see the way to subjective perfection, though it's often traded away, and rightly so.</p>
