It's fun but clearly doomed to be imperfect. I have some ideas for the coming week about how to balance user input with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> needs.</p>

<p>Among other sources, I tried ChatGPT to explore the world of often-lower-cased name particles (such as "von" or "al-"). Being able to ask follow-up questions was useful, and revealed more than once that it had made a particle up from whole cloth.</p>

<p>After listening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/podcasts/ai-vibe-check-with-ezra-klein-and-kevin-tries-phone-positivity.html">a discussion about "phone positivity" on Hard Fork</a>, I turned off <a href="https://one-sec.app/">one sec</a>.</p>

<p>It feels odd but very convenient for apps like Facebook to just launch immediately.</p>

<p>The "AI vibe check" part of that episode was fascinating as well. I listened to it in the car after dropping my partner off at a concert.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I read <a href="https://book.stevejobsarchive.com/">Make Something Wonderful: Steve Jobs in his own words</a> in Safari on my phone (not on my Kindle) and there was something quite nice about having a default thing to read on the phone for a few days.</p>

<p>The web book felt unusually robust, remembering its position across reading sessions. It's a shame this stands out, but it did.</p>

<p>Reading it was a good reminder that computers inside books picking up signals from the ether, now taken for granted, were once science fiction.</p>

<p>I finished the book while having lunch outdoors in lovely weather (after some rainy days) at a pub in the hills above town. Then walked the scenic route home.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9411972/">Where the Crawdads Sing (2022)</a> which was pretty good, if a bit <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sk%C3%A4mskudde">skämskudde</a> in places. I finished it on my own since my partner gave up in disgust after the CGI bird and "people forget about creatures that live in shells" one-two punch.</p>

<p>We rewatched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/">Rope (1948)</a>. Very good, of course. We may expand this into another few Hitchcock movie nights.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I read <a href="https://qntm.org/scp">"There Is No Antimemetics Division" by qntm</a>. Fascinating sci-fi based around not-remembering, though it got a bit much towards the end.</p>

<p>I realised afterwards that I've read <a href="https://qntm.org/ra">Ra</a> by the same author (about the scientific discovery of magic, and what follows) and felt much the same about that one.</p>
