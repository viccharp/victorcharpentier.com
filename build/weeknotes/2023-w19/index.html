<p>Traffic was hugely backed up due to roadworks and trains were on strike, so I dusted off my bike.</p>

<p>It was really nice. About 30 minutes at a leisurely pace along the canal, past allotments and the hippie canalboat community and pubs and angry geese.</p>

<p>It's not the ideal bike for it, though ‚Äì the canal overflows are rough and cobbled and it's a rather fair-surface bike. I walked it across those bits.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about getting a more appropriate bike, and it's hard to separate the overly aspirational from what I think I'd actually do.</p>

<p>We watched the Eurovision finals with friends.</p>

<p>I'm not a Eurovision fan, but it was a lovely social event with delicious food.</p>

<p>I watched season one of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5348176/">Barry (2018‚Äì2023)</a> and liked it. Good balance of humour and drama; deftly flawed characters; interesting developments in the relationships between various characters.</p>

<p>I watched the first episode of season two and it went way heavier on the humour in a way that felt completely out of character; hopefully it gets better.</p>

<p>We watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112857/">Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)</a>. Excellent modern (üë¥üèª) noir.</p>

<p>We re-watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">Alien (1979)</a>. Great lived-in future. Appreciate the evil corporation angle and Jonesy the cat upping the stakes. Great pacing. Pleasing <a href="https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/alien/">title sequence</a>.</p>

<p>It was hard to take <em>that scene</em> seriously having seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otJ2rXMuLno">Space Balls</a>.</p>

<p>We had the plumbers here to fix an outdoor tap, and I asked them to also install <a href="/weeknotes/2023-w17#tap">the new bathroom tap</a> since I hadn't gotten around to it.</p>

<p>I'm glad I did ‚Äì it was more complicated than expected. It's always tricky as a homeowner whether to DIY or pay someone to do it.</p>

<p>I'm proud of how much better we've gotten at resolving conflicts at work. In the early days, we were not.</p>

<p>This week I was in a Slack discussion (about calendar conventions!) that was heating up, and a first shot was fired in a would-be documentation edit war.</p>

<p>I suggested "<a href="https://tuple.app/">Tuple</a>?", got a "üëç", and we had a constructive and friendly 5 minute discussion where we happily agreed on some changes.</p>

<p>Increasing bandwidth when text-based communication runs into conflict is a good habit.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">‚úß‚úß‚úß</div>

<p>I modernised a Slack integration and took the opportunity to introduce <a href="https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk">Zeitwerk</a> in our internal Ruby-but-not-Rails chat bot app. Worked really well.</p>

<p>I also cleaned up some magic encoding comments that haven't been needed since Ruby 2.0 was released a decade ago. This app has been around a while.</p>
