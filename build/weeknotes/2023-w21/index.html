<p>It's where I'm from and where my employer is based.</p>

<p>It was a whirlwind with late nights and earlier mornings than I'm used to.</p>

<p>Having to actually get out of bed to catch a commuter train is a bit of a drag, but it was a fun change of pace to be in an office with coworkers for a few days. And it's easy to hit my Apple Watch calorie goal when walking to and from the commuter train…</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>Travelling alone is great. I'm a fast walker and a smoothly rolling suitcase on a hard airport floor invites maximum speed and daring overtakes, which my partner does not enjoy.</p>

<p>I did some coding at the gate for my outbound flight. It's amazing how much you can get done with fewer distractions; I should find ways of achieving that during regular working hours.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I attended the <a href="https://agilasverige.se/">Agila Sverige</a> conference again. It was good as always, and draining as always.</p>

<p>Next year I think I'll do <a href="https://socratesuk.org/">SoCraTes UK</a> for a change of pace.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I'd brought <a href="https://www.catdancer.com/product/cat-dancer/">Cat Dancers</a> for the Slack <code>#cats</code> gang at work (because why not).</p>

<p>I had a spare one in my bag and gave it to a fellow conference-goer when I learned she had cats. I love giving unexpected gifts.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I think I'm an elective extrovert – I enjoy being around people and feel more energised than drained, but I'm also very happy on my own or with my partner for weeks on end.</p>

<p>There was a lot of socialising on this trip.</p>

<p>The little team I lead went karting and had dinner together.</p>

<p>I partook in after-work shuffleboard in a dimly lit dive bar.</p>

<p>I went on a walk with an old friend and then had pizza by her pool. We went charity shop crawling and I spooked a cookbook-reading employee by suggesting <a href="https://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/stuff-we-also-eat-flygande-jakob/">the very dish</a> it turned out she'd planned on making that evening.</p>

<p>I thought I'd missed my chance to meet one far-flung friend, but then realised I could drop by on my way back from a further-flung friend, so I did.</p>
