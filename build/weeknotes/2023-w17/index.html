<p>We're visiting a friend this weekend. We can't charge the car at her house, so public chargers it is.</p>

<p>At home I just plug it in and it's ready when we need it. EVs are a bit less convenient when you can't just charge where you're parked.</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://hond.ae">a delightful car with rather limited range</a>. We arrived the other day with 3%. While it was charging Saturday morning, I enjoyed a walk down to the seaside and back as the town was waking up. I did the same thing last visit, so it's becoming a nice tradition.</p>

<p>Now, Sunday, I'm topping it up for the trip back.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>On the Saturday we explored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenscar,_North_Yorkshire">Ravenscar</a>, the scenic site of a failed resort.</p>

<p>The drive was super atmospheric and foggy.</p>

<p>We had a cold but cosy picnic overlooking the North Sea.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>On the trip back home from Scarborough, I tried Apple Maps instead of our usual Google Maps since it recommended a somewhat shorter route. Got home with about 10%.</p>

<p>Both drives were lovely. Yorkshire is beautiful. I used to think of driving as a necessary evil to get from A to B, but these days I enjoy it.</p>

<p>And I quite liked Apple Maps. I think the guidance was clearer and it showed roundabouts better.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>Earlier in the week, at work, I had reason to think again about the tension between delivering on "your" task and helping others.</p>

<p>I've learned over the years that it can be very stressful if you don't find that balance.</p>

<p>I also had a lot of fun <a href="https://ruby.social/@henrik/110266209170030096">squashing a test flake</a> and <a href="https://ruby.social/@henrik/110271881520452788">cowboy-coding a script</a>.</p>

<p>ChatGPT went from a convenient search engine to being seriously useful.</p>

<p>I was working on a somewhat complicated database query. I tried asking ChatGPT about a simplified example of the query, and it suggested a workable solution. After a few rounds of me clarifying some implicit assumptions – like "this value can never be null" – its suggestion was pretty much plug and play.</p>

<p>The friend we visited is an artist, and my partner is too. Their take on AI (mostly focused on image generation) is understandably less optimistic than mine.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I enjoyed two Wikipedia rabbit holes this week.</p>

<p>The first one was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216#A_series">ISO 216 A series</a>. I knew A4 paper is A3 folded in half and so on, but appreciated the explanation of <em>why</em> a 1:√2 aspect ratio ensures this. And I love that there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216#Matching_technical_pen_widths">corresponding pen width scale</a>: you can make an A3 drawing, copy it down to A4, and exactly match the reduced line width.</p>

<p>The other rabbit hole was various forms of creative malice. As with phishing scams and such, I can really appreciate the ingenuity, ethics aside.</p>

  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_fax">Black fax</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip bomb</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion laughs attack</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Not malicious, but related:</p>

<p><a name="tap"></a></p>

<p>One of our bathroom taps is noisy.</p>

<p>I had trouble sourcing a replacement part, so I ordered a new tap, intending only to replace that part. Turns out the part has changed, so I guess I'll be replacing the whole tap after all.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I'm seeing a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky_Social">Bluesky</a> chatter. Curious to see where this will all lead.</p>

<p>I like Mastodon, and it's achieved critical mass in the tech space, but it does have a <em>lot</em> of shortcomings.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I watched:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14403178/">Beef (2023–)</a>. Everyone at work recommended it. So far, 5 episodes in, I think it's <em>fine</em>. Good first episode that pulls you in, but it loses steam.</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212346/">Miss Congeniality (2000)</a>. Entertaining enough but not very memorable. The famous "perfect date", curiously, was this Tuesday.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Stan Fields:</strong> Miss Rhode Island, please describe your idea of a perfect date.<br />
<strong>Miss Rhode Island:</strong> That's a tough one. I'd have to say April 25th. Because it's not too hot, not too cold, all you need is a light jacket.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084021/">Grease 2 (1982)</a>. Rewatch. Not a good movie as such but enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074988/">Nuts in May (1976)</a>. Rewatch. Masterful.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21104890/">Gudetama (2022–)</a>. Good, which is more than I expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our house was built in 1906. I've previously looked at the 1911 and 1939 censuses.</p>

<p>I realised the 1921 census has been released as well, so I paid a few pounds to see it.</p>

<p>There's something uncomfortable and inexorable about checking who lived at your house 10 years apart or so. Will we live here in 10 years time? In 20?</p>

<p>Speaking of Time's scythe, I enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St4qEymhI30">"Clock" by Neil Gaiman and FourPlay (and William Shakespeare)</a>.</p>
