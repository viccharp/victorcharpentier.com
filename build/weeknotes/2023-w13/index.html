I can see green hills and blue skies out the window.</p>

<p>I'm watching the Formula 1 race (not live) but will have to head out after.</p>

<p>It's been a jigsaw puzzle week.</p>

<p><a name="earthly-delights"></a></p>

<p>We got the <a href="https://www.educaborras.com/en/product/2000-the-garden-of-earthly-delights/">2000 piece "Garden of Earthly Delights" puzzle from Educa</a> and it's fantastic. Lots of great details. Best one so far.</p>

<p>I thought the enlarged crops at the top and bottom (that help it fit their standard size) would be annoying, but they just add interest.</p>

<p>We've been spending a few hours every evening on it. It really pulls you in – the next little win is always within reach.</p>

<p>The soundtrack this time has mostly been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Clyua6LKk">Hildegard von Bingen</a>. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVRunwyoTMA">Roy Orbison</a>, and Kjell Höglund's beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbZMcKEyPDY">"Genesarets sjö"</a>.</p>

<p>Haven't watched a lot of TV or movies this week what with the jigsaw puzzling.</p>

<p>We did see <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/">Speed (1994)</a>. Great action; rather stilted dialogue (which was apparently written by Joss Whedon). Didn't think Dennis Hopper's villain was compelling. It reminded me of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112864/">Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995)</a> where Jeremy Irons played a much better villain.</p>

<p>It was the last week of cooldown at work. Had 1-on-1s with my team. Getting the hang of those.</p>

<p>Booked a work trip back to my native Sweden. I've learned one week is my limit – it's nice to meet family, friends and coworkers, but I miss life back here.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I had a nightmare where I was in a personal meeting on my computer and then a coworker spoke up and said I was also in a work meeting, unmuted.</p>

<p>It's like that classic "school without trousers" dream but for the modern age.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.josemunozmatos.com/">Jose Munoz's site</a>, I updated my <a href="/uses">/uses</a> page, including some images. More to come, probably.</p>
