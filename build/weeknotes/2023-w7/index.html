I've enjoyed reading weeknotes by <a href="https://denisdefreyne.com/weeknotes/">Denis Defreyne</a> and others, so I thought I'd try it myself.</p>

<p>At work, this was the last week of <a href="https://github.com/barsoom/devbook/tree/master/process#shape-up">cooldown</a>.</p>

<p>I arranged for the customer support team to onboard us (the product development Public Site Team) so we can do it one day per cooldown. I think we'll learn a lot.</p>

<p>When I suggested this, <a href="https://fbergman.se">Fred</a> recommended two Rework Podcast episodes (<a href="https://37signals.com/podcast/put-everyone-on-the-front-lines/">Put Everyone on the Front Lines</a>, <a href="https://37signals.com/podcast/tales-from-the-front-lines/">Tales from the Front Lines</a>). I listened to them in the back garden walking our indoor cat on a lead.</p>

<p>At our Friday afternoon social, I showed the <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc browser</a>. I've used it for about two weeks now, and I really like it, despite some bugs and quirks.</p>

<p>I've been using my new Apple Studio Display all week. The single-cable lifestyle is great. The camera is the least good part ‚Äì not so much the picture quality but the wide angle. Centre Stage gets you a more useful crop, but it's distracting how it tracks movement.</p>

<p>I tried <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0921N4BRS">a desk mat</a> and wasn't a fan ‚Äì I think I'll keep going without.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">‚úß‚úß‚úß</div>

<p>As part of our "cosy cabins and camps" theme, my partner and I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055277/">The Parent Trap (1961)</a> followed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120783/">The Parent Trap (1998)</a>. The 1961 version was great, and the special effects (making twins out of one actor) are impressive.</p>

<p>They supposedly only meant to have a few of those shots, but Walt Disney had them add lots more after seeing how good they were.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the newer one isn't a scene-by-scene rehash, but the parents are less charismatic and the emotional scenes don't have the same impact.</p>

<p>We also rewatched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780521/">The Princess and the Frog (2009)</a>. It was fine.</p>

<p>I started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/">The Last of Us (2023‚Äì)</a>. Never played the game. Two episodes in, it's pretty good. I love post-apocalyptic takes.</p>

<p>After a lazy winter, I've started doing more work around the house again.</p>

<p>I drove to collect some used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh">Mackintosh</a>-inspired chairs for our parlour/dining room (<a href="https://www.cassina.com/gb/en/products/hill-house-1.html#292-hill-house-1_33159">this model</a>, but two for ¬£60). They're going with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/klimpfjaell-dining-table-grey-brown-30434657/">an IKEA table</a> and it's all being painted black. I've just primed the table with a shellack-based primer as I write this.</p>

<p>Having a big, solid dinner table is amazing ‚Äì haven't really had one before.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">‚úß‚úß‚úß</div>

<p>I briefly tried the launcher <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> as an alternative to <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>. I love the confetti command, and it looks more modern. Other than that, I need to try it more.</p>

<p>I organised my notes in Notes.app a bit more, and watched some YouTube videos about note organisation (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmB15Uzzbjw&amp;list=LL&amp;index=4&amp;t=10s">this one</a>). I <em>love</em> organising things, but I feel like I don't have my notes organised as well as I could. I'm curious about <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>.</p>

<p>I started modernising my personal site (this one!) and ended up re-implementing it with <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> so it's easier to maintain now that it has things like weeknotes.</p>

<p>Our normally-greedy cat Vincent was off his food for several days, so we took him to the vet. Doing much better after some pills. Very <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC372253/">grateful</a> he will accept the pills in food.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">‚úß‚úß‚úß</div>

<p>I'm between books, which is always disconcerting.</p>

<p>I should probably pick up <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45309582-shorefall">Shorefall</a> by Robert Jackson Bennett. It's the sequel to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside">Foundryside</a> which was great in many ways, including perhaps the best magic system I've seen, but for some reason I'm not particularly keen to read more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">‚úß‚úß‚úß</div>

<p>We went on a walk in <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/yorkshire/hardcastle-crags">Hardcastle Crags</a> in the next town over.</p>

<p>We've been before, but hadn't gone into Gibson Mill previously. I love that they used to have summer camps and a roller-skating rink.</p>
