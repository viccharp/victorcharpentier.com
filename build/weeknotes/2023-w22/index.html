<p>As always, I was thrilled to get into my own car at the airport. I love <a href="https://hond.ae/">that thing</a>, and I love the drive back.</p>

<p>It was slightly magical to get home – our wisteria in full bloom, church bells ringing, evening falling on the valley.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>At work, I made a <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> SQL-backed dashboard showing the progress of something we're rolling out.</p>

<p>ChatGPT, for all its faults, turned out to be an amazing Metabase collaborator.</p>

<p>I gave it a fairly detailed description of the tables I had and the kind of diagram I wanted, and the query it returned <em>worked perfectly</em>. I can figure out fairly advanced stuff in SQL, but it will take me a while, and this was a huge time saver.</p>

<p>I kept using it to evolve the dashboard and it kept being incredibly useful.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I watched a bunch of stuff.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/">Dark City (1998)</a>. Rewatch. Not very good. I'm astounded that IMDb reviewers seem to find the plot profound.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14676562/">The Gallows Pole (2023–)</a> is set in one of our neighbouring villages and filmed in another. I watched the first 2 episodes – decent, with some well done naturalistic dialogue. I'm genuinely offended by the ungrammatical "Old English" in the credits and episode titles. "Booketh" as a noun? "Thy had a dream"? Stupid.</p>

<p>I didn't expect to like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11358390/">Renfield (2023)</a>, but I did. Funny, good action sequences, good cast.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213663/">The World's End (2013)</a> was pretty good. Lots of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213663/trivia/">callbacks</a>.</p>

<p>And I went on a Buster Keaton binge. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/">Sherlock Jr. (1924)</a> (fantastic), <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017925/">The General (1926)</a> (likewise) and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019421/">Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)</a> (some incredible scenes but not as good overall). It's amazing to think that this was nearly 100 years ago. With a well-told story, you don't really notice or care that it's black and white and silent. Highly recommend.</p>

<p>On the Saturday, we went to <a href="https://royalarmouries.org/">the Royal Armouries in Leeds</a> for a Wild West show – it's one of my partner's many special interests. It was a lovely day out.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>On the Sunday, we gardened and had amazing BBQ under a parasol.</p>

<p>I'm very excited about Apple's WWDC keynote tomorrow, with the rumoured AR/VR headset. I see a lot of promise that hasn't been realised yet.</p>
