Both because the end users contacting support are affected by our work, and because we support the support team, so we need to understand their situation.</p>

<p>It was hard, fun and educational. It confirmed suspicions we'd had about a problematic bit of UX.</p>

<p>We watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105690/">Under Siege (1992)</a>. Had its moments but not great. Steven Seagal has a strange vibe.</p>

<p><a name="pelican-brief"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107798/">The Pelican Brief (1993)</a> was rather good. One of those movies where the quality of the main actors definitely elevate it. I think I arbitrarily picked this as My Favourite Movie at some point as a kid, but I'm pretty sure I only saw it once. (Now twice.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118928/">Dante's Peak (1997)</a> had a beautiful setting (Wallace, Idaho) and great set pieces. Think it could have been strung together better, especially towards the end. Pierce Brosnan in short-sleeved Alan Grant shirts made me long for summer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/">Kindergarten Cop (1990)</a> was enjoyable. Again in a lovely setting (Astoria, Oregon). It felt unusual that they acknowledged Arnold's accent in-world.</p>

<p>It's a pretty recent development for me to watch movies regularly. I just haven't been in the habit before. I think it helps that we now have a pretty nice surround sound <a href="https://henrik.nyh.se/uses/#tv">setup</a>. Makes it more of a quality experience.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50689515">Clutter: An Untidy History</a> by Jennifer Howard.</p>

<p>Strangely compelling so far. Good writing does that.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>On the Sunday, we decided on a whim to drive to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malham_Cove">Malham Cove</a>. Haven't been before.</p>

<p>About an hour away through the beautiful Yorkshire Dales.</p>

<p>Many narrow roads where passing takes some coordination. There's a lot of that around there and I've gone from feeling nervous about it to kind of enjoying it. It's friendly and collaborative.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I stumbled over <a href="https://persephonemanor.com/">Persephone Manor</a> on Reddit, and it made me really happy.</p>

<p>I think because we too theme the rooms of our house pretty heavily; and I too love going over the top with home tech; and I too love making detailed inventories.</p>

<p>I would not make a page or a home like this, but I can totally see why one would.</p>
