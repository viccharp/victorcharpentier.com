<p>We've barbecued and gardened and had breakfast outside.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I've resumed our pond project from last summer. The first step is to build a little retaining wall, and the first step of <em>that</em> is to dig a trench.</p>

<p>I don't mind the digging, but carrying surplus soil up the sloped garden to dispose of it is hard work. I use it to flatten out the slope under our swing seat.</p>

<p>If it was a bigger project I'd look into some sort of conveyor belt.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>Work feels like an age ago.</p>

<p>I've been pairing with a similarly senior developer for a change, and collaborating more closely with a designer than usual. It's a lot of fun.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I had a routine eye test. My glasses are falling apart and I wanted an up-to-date prescription for new ones.</p>

<p>The optician took eye-health photos and studied them for a few minutes. My mind (calmly) wandered into thoughts about programming via voice control and whether I could do my job if I lost my eyesight. Then he was done and said it was all fine.</p>

<p>As usual I had a ton of questions about how eye tests and prescriptions work, but held back because he probably didn't want to talk to me all day.</p>

<p>I watched some videos about it afterwards, to my partner's amusement.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I also watched:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119528/">Liar Liar (1997)</a>. First time I've seen it. Entertaining but the inconsistent internal logic offended me. For most of the movie he can't lie by omission, until it's convenient for the plot.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/">Tremors (1990)</a>. Also for the first time. Enjoyed it a lot. I appreciated the non-dumb hicks and the mostly unsexualised female lead.</p>

<p>I finished <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/">Goodfellas (1990)</a> which I had started the week before. Not quite my kind of movie, but I can't deny it was skillfully made. The drug-paranoia sequence was intense.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/">True Lies (1994)</a> was a rewatch. Very good action sequences, though I could have done without the misogynistic sidekick.</p>

<p>I think I've given up on The Mandalorian. I watched one more episode and it seems to have lost its magic.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p><a name="pompeii"></a></p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/880.Pompeii">"Pompeii" by Robert Harris</a> which was really good. Good human drama. Interesting to learn more about Roman life and about the eruption. Appreciated that the main character is a water engineer.</p>

<p>I was sad to learn they planned on making it into a movie but never did.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>My employer hooked us up with <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>. So far, I think it's a net productivity win, but a modest one.</p>

<p>It's rather convenient when it suggests the thing that's in your head, so you don't have to type it out.</p>

<p>It's more of a mixed bag when it outputs a bunch of code before you've thought that far ahead. Suddenly you need to review someone else's code. It's like your pair partner suddenly took the keyboard and wrote out a bunch of code without explanation.</p>
