<p>My partner is a huge Disney theme park fan. We used to go to some Disney park almost every year, but now it's been a decade.</p>

<p>There was an issue with their system butchering my partner's name, which can invalidate an airline ticket. The mismatch between Disney's glittery marketing and the profit-seeking reality is fascinating.</p>

<p>After they mentioned there might be an amendment fee and I expressed displeasure, they used phrases like "let's get everything back on the magical track" – instead of actually making it "magical" by silently eating that cost. Not to mention fixing their site. They did cover it in the end.</p>

<p>My partner is now going through hours and hours of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DFBGuide">Disney Food Blog videos</a> in preparation. So many places to eat; so little time.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>Speaking of names, <a href="/weeknotes/2023-w15">our name-handling code</a> has been in production for a while and has worked great so far, which is a little disappointing. I was hoping for more interesting edge cases.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I got stopped by the police for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>I saw flashing lights in my rear-view mirror and moved aside to let them pass, but they stayed behind me, so I pulled over.</p>

<p>They'd looked up the number plate on my car and saw it wasn't insured. Then they realised the number was for a motorcycle. Then they realised they got a letter wrong.</p>

<p>ChatGPT wrote me a whole script at work for something and I was delighted at its biggest time savings yet.</p>

<p>Then it turned out those API endpoints did not exist, and the whole thing I wanted to do is in fact unsupported. This future is weird.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I got an invite to <a href="https://www.raycast.com/ai">Raycast AI</a>.</p>

<p>Curious to see if I will use this tool more when it's right at my fingertips.</p>

<p>A cool feature is that you can highlight text in any app (a web page, a text editor, an email) and run it through one-off or predefinable prompts. You can make it summarise texts, or translate them, or change their writing style.</p>

<p>It seems theoretically very promising, but I'm realising I'm not sure what I would actually want to use it for.</p>

<p>I think summarising long texts might be genuinely useful, or explaining code, or finding bugs in code.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://ruby.social/@henrik/110318654230937709">made it remove the filler on an online recipe</a> which was neat, but since it tends to hallucinate, I don't think I would follow a recipe that's been through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a>. I could see it working with the right constraints – perhaps running in a browser and identifying the text to remove, but not modifying the remaining text.</p>

<p>Someone shared the <a href="https://github.com/SKaplanOfficial/Raycast-PromptLab">PromptLab</a> extension which lets you feed files, today's weather etc into the AI and also run scripts against its output. I am again wary, but it's a fascinating field.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>We rewatched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106697/">Demolition Man (1993)</a>. Not quite as good as I remember, but it's an entertaining take on the future (the year 2032). Only 9 years until the seashells!</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I just pre-ordered the <a href="https://www.onlycat.com/">OnlyCat</a> cat flap. It uses a camera to deny access if carrying prey.</p>

<p>I've been hesitant since our current "smart" cat flap started out not being too reliable and got better over time. But I'm willing to gamble on the chance of a life where we don't chase mice in the middle of the night or blot their remains out of the carpet.</p>

<p>We ate in the garden yesterday and it was unusually quiet. We eventually realised it was because everyone was indoors watching the coronation. We watched a little.</p>
