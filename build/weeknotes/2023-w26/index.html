I rather enjoy it, especially seeing coworkers on Zoom melting in the Scandinavian heat.</p>

<p>The boiler stays off, but we've closed the windows and brought out the hottie botties.</p>

<p>At work, the Summer Cycle has begun – whoever's not on holiday works on tasks that don't require access to stakeholders. Sweden (where my employer is based) kind of shuts down over summer and I like it.</p>

<p>In my role as a manager, I also did something outside my comfort zone. It went well, and I feel like I've levelled up a little.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I drove to Burnley for some takeaway, listening to Marilyn Manson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Animals">Mechanical Animals (1998)</a> of all things, after hearing a snippet on a podcast. Very nostalgic.</p>

<p>There's something liminal and cosy about reading in a KFC booth as you wait for your food to be ready, but they were disappointingly quick.</p>

<p>I picked up a carpet cleaner at the town <a href="https://todmordenmakery.org.uk/tool-library/">tool library</a>. Such a good resource. I've previously brought my bike to their (also free) bike repair drop-in.</p>

<p>We haven't used the carpet cleaner yet but I'm <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/search/?q=carpet%20cleaning">looking forward to it</a>!</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>We went to IKEA.</p>

<p>After a click-and-collect hiccup, some of the stuff we went there for was not available, but we ended up buying <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/poaeng-armchair-black-brown-skiftebo-dark-grey-s89388465/">an extremely comfortable armchair</a> (and ottoman) on impulse. It's now in my home office.</p>

<div class="weeknote-separator">✧✧✧</div>

<p>I watched the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/">Silo</a> finale. Other than a nailbiting episode 3, Silo wasn't very good. One of those shows you watch for the destination; not the journey. Thankfully it's based on a book series, so I spent 5 minutes reading summaries and now I don't need to watch any more.</p>

<p>I also watched the first three episodes of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/">Black Mirror</a> season 6. Reasonably good, though parts were unconvincing (the episode 1 legalities; the episode 3 ending). I was amused to learn that the cosy American town in episode 3 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye,_East_Sussex">Rye, UK</a>, which I've visited.</p>
